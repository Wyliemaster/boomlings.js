# Setup

The Setup for the config is fairly simple. below is a table of how each section is used

| Component | description |
|:----------|:------------|
| `token` | This is your [bot Token](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) which should be hidden from the public at all times. This token is essentially the password for the bot, you can get a token from the [discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) |
| `server` | This is the server the bot will be interacting with. By default it interacts with RobTops servers however, you can change it to a private server if you wish to do so |
| `prefix` | The Prefix is used to trigger a command. you would start a command with the prefix and then you would follow the prefix with the command name |
| `commandColour` | The Hex colour code for the command embeds |
| `customStatus` | The bot's status on discord |
